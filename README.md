## Welcome!

O!MPD is free, opensource [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/) client based on PHP and MySQL.

MPD is a brilliant application that plays music from many sources, in many formats, but it has no user interface. O!MPD is what MPD needs: user interface which can control MPD and lets you browse your music library in the way you surf the internet.

O!MPD is a fork of [netjukebox](http://www.netjukebox.nl/) (5.37).

While netjukebox also supports VideoLAN and Winamp/httpQ, O!MPD supports O!nly MPD.
